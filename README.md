#### AUTOMATION USING SENSORS AND ARDUINO

Agriculture 4.0, or Digital Agriculture, is a trend in agrobusiness, including a greater focus on Precision Agriculture, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of Big Data to generate greater efficiency as a result of population growth and climate change.
With the objective of producing more and better, with less, in order to increase food supply and reduce waste in a sustainable way, one of the 4 pillars of support of Agriculture 4.0 is the collection and management of field data.

The project consists of using sensor and the Arduino platform to:
- Construction of low-cost weather stations spread across the plantation fields, collecting data in real time.
- The creation of automated greenhouses to control meteorological parameters in order to create an ideal microenvironment and thus enable the maximum development of the vegetable culture.
- Thermal comfort in animal production.

Having all digital devices connected to databases, networks and the internet, so that they “talk” to each other or can be accessed from a distance, enabling faster and better decision making.
The result is improved agricultural productivity and efficiency in the use of inputs, while increasing worker safety, reducing environmental impacts and reducing costs.
